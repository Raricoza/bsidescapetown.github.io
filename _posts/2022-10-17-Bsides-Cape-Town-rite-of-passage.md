## Rite of passage
As a non-profit company and community run event, we like to give back to the 'up and coming hackers' of South Africa. 
BSIDES Cape Town has in past years sent a student volunteer to Defcon and Bsides Las Vegas to volunteer and experience the magic of the ultimate hacker summer camp.
This initiative was used to bring the learnings and energy of Bsides Las Vegas back to South Africa and influence the new generation of hackers in the community.

As travelling to the US is a mammoth undertaking, we have done some thinking about the future of the rite of passage. 
Though we do not rule out going to Vegas in the future, we would also like to support local initiatives. We would like to engage students and young hackers in furthering their skills
and education. 

## Donate
We allow sponsoring towards rite of passage as part of the 2022 conference ticket page: [Quicket](https://www.quicket.co.za/events/161679-bsides-cape-town-2022-december-conference/#/tickets)
Look for rite of passage and enter an amount, whatever you feel you would like to give to the community.
