## CFP/CFW Formats
Talk formats

**We have 5 Session Types**

95% of you will be aiming for a Standard Talk, and below are the details

# Standard Talk: / 45 minutes
This is the usual kind of talk most people submit. This time includes opportunities for questions.

# Short Talk / 30 minutes
Like a standard talk, but most likely shorter.

# Lightning Talk / 10 minutes
Here is your brief chance to cover a thought, subject or perhaps gain support for a project you are working on. You have 10 (Maybe 15Min, make it count!)

# Workshop / 120 minutes
This year we want to do a bunch of Workshops. We set it at 120min (Because we had to put in a number). If you have a workshop idea, whether it is 60 min, or half a day, use this slot. We are POSSIBLY considering doing long form workshops on the Friday, so stay tuned.

# Keynote / 60 minutes
We are honored to consider keynotes from every corner of the planet, including right here at home. Keynote is hidden from the public, so get in touch with the team or email us on the addy below, for the code to submit. Your keynote does not need to be 60 min, we just had to put a length in.

## Deadline
The deadline for submissions is 30 September 2023, but the earlier you submit the better.

We encourage all speakers to submit their proposals, regardless of the specific topic. If you believe your talk would be of interest to our attendees, we want to hear from you! Our goal is to offer a diverse and engaging program that reflects the broad scope of cybersecurity. We welcome fresh perspectives, unique insights, and innovative ideas.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to your submissions and to seeing you at BSides Cape Town 2023!
