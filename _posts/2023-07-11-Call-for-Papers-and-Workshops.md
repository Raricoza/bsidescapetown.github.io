![Call for Papers and Workshops](/assets/images/2023/cfp/cfp_banner.png)

## Speakers and Trainers apply!

We are still buzzing on the energy of Bsides Cape Town 2022 and are excited to announce the Call for Papers (CFP) and Call for Workshops (CFW)! We call all hackers, defenders, developers and researchers to send us their proposals! We would also like to get more workshops this year as we received very good feedback on the 2022 workshops.

## Theme
Enter a world where technology and humanity collide, where cyber threats abound, and the future teeters on the edge. Welcome to "Dystopia Now." Join us as we unravel the dark side of the digital realm and explore the intersection of cybersecurity and society. Step into the future and be part of the movement shaping a safer tomorrow.

## Process

Submit your talk here : ![CFP/CFW website}(https://pretalx.com/bsides-cape-town-2023/cfp).

## CFP/CFW Formats

Talk formats (Selected under Session Type)

We have 5 Session Types

95% of you will be aiming for a Standard Talk, and below are the details

Standard Talk: / 45 minutes
This is the usual kind of talk most people submit. This time includes opportunities for questions.

Short Talk / 30 minutes
Like a standard talk, but most likely shorter.

Lightning Talk / 10 minutes
Here is your brief chance to cover a thought, subject or perhaps gain support for a project you are working on. You have 10 (Maybe 15Min, make it count!)

Workshop / 120 minutes
This year we want to do a bunch of Workshops. We set it at 120min (Because we had to put in a number). If you have a workshop idea, whether it is 60 min, or half a day, use this slot. We are POSSIBLY considering doing long form workshops on the Friday, so stay tuned.

Keynote / 60 minutes
We are honored to consider keynotes from every corner of the planet, including right here at home. Keynote is hidden from the public, so get in touch with the team or email us on the addy below, for the code to submit. Your keynote does not need to be 60 min, we just had to put a length in.

## Deadline
The deadline for submissions is 31 September 2023, but the earlier you submit the better. 

## Never done a talk before?
Not a problem! We are a community and volunteer driven organization. We would like to invite anyone to submit, we will even assist you if your talk is selected.
