# Bsides Cape Town Conference - What to Expect?
 
BSIDES Cape Town runs on the following formula: BSIDES Conference = Hackers + Talks + Challenges + Volunteers + Curiosity.

BSIDES has been an amazing yearly conference showcasing the research of local and internationally acclaimed hackers, defenders, curious people and all interested in security.
I (CrypticGoose/Christo) have been fortunate to be on the organizing committee for nearly 7 years and before that a volunteer, so I will take you on a journey with photos of what a
BSIDES Cape Town conference day is like.

## About BSIDES Cape Town
BSides Cape Town is an annual information security conference bringing together cybersecurity
professionals, hackers, and technology enthusiasts in a unique and vibrant environment.
From technical deep dives to policy discussions, BSides Cape Town embraces a wide range of
subjects in the cybersecurity landscape. The focus is on learning, innovating and having fun.
BSides is growing: the first 2011 conference was under 20 people. Last year's event was sold out at
500 people. This year we expect more than 600 hackers, tech leaders and enthusiasts to attend.

## Registration & Swag
Registration is filled with excitement and uncertainty. Tickets to be shown, amazing swag to be received and waiting for talks to begin.
Grab a coffee, meet some other weird and wonderful hackers. Go see our amazing vendors in the vendor area. 

At registration will be your first opportunity to meet our amazing team of organizers and volunteers that make BSIDES Cape Town happen and serve you on the day.

## Mingle
Before the event starts or inbetween talks you get to mingle with the world's best local bred hackers and vendors that make
the event possible. Our wonderful sponsors setup tables in our vendor area where you can learn more about their offerings
or job opportunities.

In the corridors,the spaces between people meet, hack on things and discover new interests. That is why we love having BSIDES Cape Town in person.
Throughout the year you have the opportunity to join and interact with hackers on the [Hack South](https://hacksouth.africa/community/Joining-Hack-South/) discord
and then at the end of the year meet your friends and heroes in person. I personally have been encouraged and my career forever changed
by rubbing shoulders with Hacker legends of South Africa and abroad at this event. 

A great little story from 2022 is that a few of our volunteers and Jayson E Street walked from the Waterfront to Woodstock the day after BSIDES Cape Town.
The friendships and hacker shenanigans continued and if you scroll far down enough on Jayson's Twitter you will find photos of them exploring the urban landscape 
most of us dare tread. Wonderful friendships across shores are made at BSIDES between people of all walks of life.

We even have a [Code of Conduct](https://bsidescapetown.co.za/codeofconduct/) for our community as we want people to feel welcome.

## Talks
Amazing conference talks! Yes other than hacking challenges and seeing your friends, our main focus is to provide you with high quality talks by local and international speakers.

We spend a lot of time requesting talks from the community and doing a blind peer review. As part of our culture and ethos we don't do paid for talks or sponsors get automatic slots for speaking.
We allow our platinum sponsor a short opening talk, but all other talks need to go through the CFP process, with external and internal reviewers, which keeps the quality 
of our talks high.

Our amazing speakers present their research, which we at a later stage upload to our youtube channel: [Bsides Cape Town](https://www.youtube.com/@BSidesCapeTown)

## Challenges
As if there isn't enough going on at our yearly conference, we usually open up a call for challenges. These challenges can include
Capture the Flag challenges where people hack to find a secret to progress, or OSINT which is an open source intelligence challenge
using your google dorking skills. Other challenges could be password cracking or even something simple like find a sticker or image hiding in the venue. 
These challenges are communicated ahead of time or on the day and all are welcome to participate.

### BSIDES Electronic badges (subject to availability)
Some years, if communicated ahead of time, we have electronic badges built by volunteers and organisers up for sale. These badges are sold 
as a separate ticket for a nominal fee, with hacking challenges attached to it. These badges can often communicate with each other, a server and challenges allowing
for a unique interactive experience on the day.

Our BSIDES Cape Town electronic challenge badges usually follow with chaotic nights and days of soldering, debugging and amazing moments building things for our community.
The BSIDES Cape Town electronic badges form part of our maker community that combines the physical and cyber.
