# Bsides Cape Town Conference - What to Expect?
 
BSIDES Cape Town runs on the following formula: BSIDES Conference = Hackers + Talks + Challenges + Volunteers + Curiosity.

BSIDES has been an amazing yearly conference showcasing the research of local and internationally acclaimed hackers, defenders, curious people and all interested in security.
I (CrypticGoose/Christo) have been fortunate to be on the organizing committee for nearly 7 years and before that a volunteer, so I will take you on a journey with photos of what a
BSIDES Cape Town conference day is like.

## Registration & Swag
Registration is filled with excitement and uncertainty. Tickets to be shown, amazing swag to be received and waiting for talks to begin.
Grab a coffee, meet some other weird and wonderful hackers. Go see our amazing vendors in the vendor area.

We all know the post BSIDES feeling. Once you get over thousands of steps taken and lack of sleep, all of us usually start
planning or researching that talk you should have given this year the day after. BSIDES welcomes you, submit that talk!
