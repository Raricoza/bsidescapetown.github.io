# Bsides Cape Town Conference - What to Expect?
 
BSIDES Cape Town runs on the following formula: BSIDES Conference = Hackers + Talks + Challenges + Volunteers + Curiosity.

BSIDES has been an amazing yearly conference showcasing the research of local and internationally acclaimed hackers, defenders, curious people and all interested in security.
I (CrypticGoose/Christo) have been fortunate to be on the organizing committee for nearly 7 years and before that a volunteer, so I will take you on a journey with photos of what a
BSIDES Cape Town conference day is like.

## Registration & Swag
Registration is filled with excitement and uncertainty. Tickets to be shown, amazing swag to be received and waiting for talks to begin.
Grab a coffee, meet some other weird and wonderful hackers. Go see our amazing vendors in the vendor area. 

At registration will be your first opportunity to meet our amazing team of organizers and volunteers that make BSIDES Cape Town happen and serve you on the day.

## Mingle
Before the event starts or inbetween talks you get to mingle with the world's best local bred hackers and vendors that make
the event possible. Our wonderful sponsors setup tables in our vendor area where you can learn more about their offerings
or job opportunities.

In the corridors,the spaces between people meet, hack on things and discover new interests. That is why we love having BSIDES Cape Town in person.
Throughout the year you have the opportunity to join and interact with hackers on the [Hack South](https://hacksouth.africa/community/Joining-Hack-South/) discord
and then at the end of the year meet your friends and heroes in person. I personally have been encouraged and my career forever changed
by rubbing shoulders with Hacker legends of South Africa and abroad at this event. 

A great little story from 2022 is that a few of our volunteers and Jayson E Street walked from the Waterfront to Woodstock the day after BSIDES Cape Town.
The friendships and hacker shenanigans continued and if you scroll far down enough on Jayson's Twitter you will find photos of them exploring the urban landscape 
most of us dare tread. Wonderful friendships across shores are made at BSIDES between people of all walks of life.

We even have a [Code of Conduct](https://bsidescapetown.co.za/codeofconduct/) for our community as we want people to feel welcome.

## Talks
Amazing conference talks! Yes other than hacking challenges and seeing your friends, our main focus is to provide you with high quality talks by local and international speakers.

We spend a lot of time requesting talks from the community and doing a blind peer review. As part of our culture and ethos we don't do paid for talks or sponsors get automatic slots for speaking.
We allow our platinum sponsor a short opening talk, but all other talks need to go through the CFP process, with external and internal reviewers, which keeps the quality 
of our talks high.

Our amazing speakers present their research, which we at a later stage upload to our youtube channel: [Bsides Cape Town](https://www.youtube.com/@BSidesCapeTown)
