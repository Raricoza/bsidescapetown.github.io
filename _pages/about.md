<p>Just like the other chapters of BSides around the world, BSides Cape Town is an  annual Information / Security conference that is different. We are a volunteer organised event, put on by and for the community. Each year there is a staff of committee members and volunteers. <!-- Meet the <a href="https://bsidescapetown.co.za/staff/">Our current staff</a>.--></p>
<p>There is a nominal fee charged to the public to attend BSides Cape Town. Currently almost 100% of our costs are covered by our generous donors and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/bsides-conf/2022-sponsorship.md %}">sponsors</a>, who share our vision of sharing information. The conversations we start are always relevant to what&#8217;s happening right now and in many instances include practical demos instead of the old school lecture style cons.</p>
<p>The Cape Town chapter of BSides can be dated back pre 2012. You can read more about that <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/past_events.md %}">here</a>.</p>
<p>To get involved, keep an eye out on Meet-up and 0xc0ffee_cpt on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/0xc0ffeeCPT/">Facebook</a>, and join our community of like minded hackers on the second Saturday of each month.</p>
