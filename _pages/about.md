Just like the other chapters of BSides around the world, BSides Cape Town is an  annual Information / Security conference that is different. We are a volunteer organised event, put on by and for the community. Each year there is a staff of committee members and volunteers. Meet the [Our current staff](/staff)  

There is a nominal fee charged to the public to attend BSides Cape Town. Currently almost 100% of our costs are covered by our generous donors and [sponsors]({% link _pages/bsides-conf/2021-sponsorship.md %}), who share our vision of sharing information. The conversations we start are always relevant to what's happening right now and in many instances include practical demos instead of the old school lecture style cons.  

The Cape Town chapter of BSides can be dated back pre 2012. You can read more about that [here]({% link _pages/past_events.md %}).

To get involved, keep an eye out on Meet-up and @0xc0ffee_cpt on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xC0FFEE_CPT), and join our community of like minded hackers on the second Saturday of each month.

Our code of conduct can be viewed [here](/codeofconduct)
