<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>If someone threatens or harrases you or anyone else, please report it as soon as possible. Conference staff can be identified by their bright red t-shirts with the word STAFF on them. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want everyone to be happy at our event.</p>
