### Vending Machine

Mike Davis in collaboration with Orange Cyberdefense will be operating a vending machine loaded with prizes of various sorts. You are invited to try to hack the vending machine, in a variety of ways.
As a gentle introduction to the machine, try entering your Quicket number to get a snack. The vending machine will be situated on the roof terrace. Come say hi!

### Scavenger Hunt

At BSides, we want there to be "Something for everyone" so on the day we will have distinctive QR codes dotted around the venue and in slides of the talks. Join the challenge by authenticating with your discord or email, and get scanning! We have also been seeding flags on social media, so you can manually enter them. 
On the day we will also have challenges where you will need to complete a given task, post it on Social Media and tag BSides with #BSidesCPT23. Keep an eye on your dm's or see the Game Master on the day to get your flag. 
 
Prizes and shenanigans for fun and profit to be had. 

### AI Challenge

AI prompts have been a hot favourite skillset this year! To that end, CrypticGoose has set up a AI Prompt challenge! Hack the passwords with 9 different levels with differing protections. Keep on eye on social media for more information.
