## Location:
Cape Town Science Centre:  [https://www.ctsc.org.za](https://www.ctsc.org.za)

As stated on their website a Science centre is: "A science centre is exactly as the word describes: a hub of science which aims to enrich the school curriculum and equip learners by providing valuable hands-on learning experiences using world class exhibits that are designed to increase learners’ skill and understanding of science, technology and maths – demystifying the world of science & technology".

We are excited to use a institution of science and innovative curiosity to host our BSIDES Cape Town 2022 event.
