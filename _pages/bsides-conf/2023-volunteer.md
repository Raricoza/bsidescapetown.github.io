Join the team and help out on the day. If you are keen to get an 'in' on what it takes to arrange a hacker conference and have a passion to work like a dog, then bring your most comfy pair of shoes and we'll find something for you to do - also we'll pay you. Just kidding. We'll organise you a beer and a high five. Maybe.  

On the day we will help with setting up the venue, herding speakers, herding conference attendees, scanning tickets, fixing badges, etc. You will get to brush shoulders with the greatest community and minds South Africa has to offer.  

As a volunteer you could also be eligible for rite of passage.  
We also pick our future organizers from volunteers.
We would love to have you so please make contact!
