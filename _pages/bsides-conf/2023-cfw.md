## The CFW for BSides Cape Town 2023 is closed!.


# Theme: Dystopia Now
Our theme for this year is Dystopia Now. We are going to solve the perceived challenges of our possible Dystopian Future...Now! We have created a few ideas, concepts and guidelines which can be found in our blog @ <LINK>. We would love talks that fit this theme. It is recommended but not necessary. In the past we have seen a decent amount of devs/DevOps people so code heavy talks are also most welcome!
